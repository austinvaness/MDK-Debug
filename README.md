# MDK-Debug
Utility plugin for Space Engineers, allowing direct debugging of Programmable Block scripts via Space Engineers. Designed for MDK projects.

** This plugin owes its existence to Inflex, which created the first version of it. By his permission I have rewritten and adapted it for use with MDK projects, but his basic methodology survives. **
